UserDefaults :

    UserDefaults are stored in .plist file. That is why we have yo assign a key and value to it as plist includes only key-value pairs.
    You will always need a key to retrive the value.
1st   var defaults = UserDefaults.standard //declared inside the class
2nd   defaults.set(value,key :"ToDoList") // value is the value we want to save in the UserDefaults directory and key is used to retrive the information when we want.
3rd   if let item = defaults.array(forKey: "ToDoList") as? [String] {
      itemArray = item
      } // This will be declared inside viewDidLoat as we want to retrive the save data inside the UserDefaults directory. In this app, the data is stored in the form of an array that is why we use this - [String]
